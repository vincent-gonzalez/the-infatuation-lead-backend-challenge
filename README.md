## How to run
A makefile has been included in the base directory. Use `make buildRun` to build and execute the program. Use `make run` to simply run the program after it has already been compiled.

As a courtesy, a compiled binary has been provided as a part of this repo. So, you may use the `make run` command to immediately execute the solution program.
